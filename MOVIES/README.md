Here are some movies from my time in Alexander Aulehla's lab at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany.

* **SO_2.0D_130mins_CTRL.avi**: E10.5 spreadout, expressing LuVeLu, subjected to 130-min periodic pulses of DMSO control, with corresponding period and phase wavelet movies
* **SO_2.0D_130mins_DAPT.avi**: E10.5 spreadout, expressing LuVeLu, subjected to 130-min periodic pulses of 2 uM DAPT, with corresponding period and phase wavelet movies
* **SO_2.0D_170mins_CTRL.avi**: E10.5 spreadout, expressing LuVeLu, subjected to 170-min periodic pulses of DMSO control, with corresponding period and phase wavelet movies
* **SO_2.0D_170mins_DAPT.avi**: E10.5 spreadout, expressing LuVeLu, subjected to 170-min periodic pulses of 2 uM DAPT, with corresponding period and phase wavelet movies
* **intactPSM_2.0D_170mins_DAPT.avi**: intact E10.5 PSM, expressing LuVeLu, cultured in PDMS microfluidics device and subjected to 170-min periodic pulses of 2 uM DAPT
* **intactPSM_inPDMSdevice.avi**: intact E10.5 PSM, expressing LuVeLu and H2B-mCherry, cultured in PDMS microfluidics device and subjected to 170-min periodic pulses of DMSO control
