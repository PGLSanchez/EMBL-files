This repository contains timeseries from microfluidics-based entrainment experiments. 

All files contain timeseries of the segmentation clock, **except** for the ones with centerROI in the filename, which contain timeseries of oscillations at the center of spreadouts (posterior PSM). Numbers near the start of the filenames indicate the concentration of drug (D: DAPT or M: MLN4924) used in uM. Periods are also specified (e.g. 140+30 = period of 170 mins). Controls (CTRL), which are samples subjected to periodic pulses of DMSO, are also included.
